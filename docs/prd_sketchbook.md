# Product Requirements Document
## DrawBot VSCode Sketchbook

### Overview
A Processing-like creative coding environment for Python using DrawBot, integrated with VSCode for seamless sketch development, experimentation, and iteration.

### Vision
Enable artists, designers, and creative coders to rapidly prototype and iterate on generative art, data visualizations, and interactive graphics using Python and DrawBot's powerful 2D graphics capabilities within a familiar development environment.

### Target Users
- **Creative Coders**: Artists and designers using code for visual expression
- **Educators**: Teaching programming through visual arts and design
- **Students**: Learning programming concepts through creative projects
- **Generative Artists**: Creating algorithmic and procedural art
- **Data Visualizers**: Building custom visual representations

### Core Features

#### 1. Sketch Management
- **Sketch Organization**: Structured folder system for organizing sketches by project, date, or theme
- **Template System**: Pre-built sketch templates for common patterns (animations, static images, interactive pieces)
- **Quick Creation**: Commands to rapidly generate new sketches from templates

#### 2. Development Environment
- **Live Preview**: Real-time preview of sketch output as code changes
- **Hot Reload**: Automatic re-execution when sketch files are saved
- **Export Integration**: One-click export to various formats (PNG, PDF, SVG, MP4)
- **Snippet Library**: Code snippets for common DrawBot operations and creative coding patterns

#### 3. Creative Tools
- **Animation Framework**: Helper functions for creating frame-based animations
- **Parameter Control**: GUI controls for tweaking sketch parameters in real-time
- **Color Palette Tools**: Built-in color palette generators and management
- **Mathematical Utilities**: Common functions for creative coding (noise, easing, interpolation)

#### 4. Learning & Documentation
- **Interactive Examples**: Curated collection of example sketches demonstrating techniques
- **Code Comments**: Enhanced commenting system for documenting creative decisions
- **Tutorial Integration**: Step-by-step tutorials for learning creative coding concepts

#### 5. Sharing & Export
- **Batch Export**: Export multiple variations or animation frames
- **Version Control**: Git integration for tracking sketch iterations
- **Portfolio Generation**: Automated portfolio page generation from sketches

### Technical Requirements

#### Core Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Graphics Library**: DrawBot
- **Editor Integration**: VSCode extensions and workspace configuration
- **File Formats**: Support for .py sketch files, various export formats

#### Performance Requirements
- **Live Preview**: < 500ms refresh time for typical sketches
- **Export Speed**: Efficient batch processing for animations and variations
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized for handling large canvas sizes and complex graphics

#### Compatibility
- **Platform**: Primary support for macOS (DrawBot requirement), with potential cross-platform alternatives
- **VSCode**: Compatible with latest VSCode versions
- **Python**: Support for virtual environments and package management

### User Stories

#### As a Creative Coder
- I want to quickly create new sketches so I can rapidly iterate on ideas
- I want to see live previews of my work so I can get immediate feedback
- I want to organize my sketches logically so I can find and reference past work

#### As an Educator
- I want example sketches and tutorials so I can teach programming concepts visually
- I want to customize templates so students can focus on core concepts
- I want easy export tools so students can share their work

#### As a Student
- I want clear examples and documentation so I can learn creative coding techniques
- I want parameter controls so I can experiment without changing code
- I want to see my code changes immediately so I can understand cause and effect

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: Number of active sketches created per week
- **Engagement**: Average time spent in live preview mode
- **Learning**: Completion rate of tutorial content
- **Output**: Number of sketches exported/shared
- **Retention**: Weekly active users over time

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)
- Basic sketch file structure and organization
- Simple live preview functionality
- Core DrawBot API integration
- Basic export capabilities

#### Phase 2: Enhancement
- Animation framework and timeline tools
- Parameter control system
- Template library expansion
- Improved VSCode integration

#### Phase 3: Community
- Example gallery and tutorials
- Sharing and collaboration features
- Advanced export and batch processing
- Plugin system for extensions

```

#### Core Components
- **Sketch Runner**: Executes and monitors sketch files
- **Preview Engine**: Renders live preview of sketch output
- **Export Manager**: Handles various export formats and batch operations
- **Template Engine**: Manages and instantiates sketch templates
- **VSCode Extension**: Provides IDE integration and commands

### Risks & Mitigations
- **DrawBot Dependency**: Limited to macOS - explore cross-platform alternatives like Cairo or Skia
- **Performance**: Large sketches may slow live preview - implement intelligent caching and optimization
- **Learning Curve**: Complex API - provide comprehensive documentation and examples
- **Maintenance**: Keep up with DrawBot updates - establish testing and compatibility processes

### Future Considerations
- **Web Version**: Browser-based version using p5.js or similar
- **Collaboration**: Real-time collaborative editing
- **AI Integration**: AI-assisted sketch generation and optimization
- **Mobile**: Companion mobile app for viewing and sharing sketches
