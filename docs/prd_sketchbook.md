- **Quick Creation**: Commands to rapidly generate new sketches from templates

#### 2. Development Environment

- **Live Preview**: Real-time preview of sketch output as code changes
- **Hot Reload**: Automatic re-execution when sketch files are saved
- **Export Integration**: One-click export to various formats (PNG, PDF, SVG)
- **VSCode Integration**: Enhanced IDE integration with dedicated commands and panels

#### 3. Creative Tools

- **Color Palette Tools**: Built-in color palette generators and management
- **Mathematical Utilities**: Common functions for creative coding (noise, easing, interpolation)
- **Snippet Library**: Code snippets for common DrawBot operations and creative coding patterns

#### 4. Learning & Documentation

- **Interactive Examples**: Curated collection of example sketches demonstrating techniques
- **Code Comments**: Enhanced commenting system for documenting creative decisions
- **Tutorial Integration**: Step-by-step tutorials for learning creative coding concepts

#### 5. Sharing & Export

- **Batch Export**: Export multiple variations or animation frames
- **Version Control**: Git integration for tracking sketch iterations
- **Portfolio Generation**: Automated portfolio page generation from sketches

### Technical Requirements

#### Core Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Graphics Library**: DrawBot
- **Editor Integration**: VSCode extensions and workspace configuration
- **File Formats**: Support for .py sketch files, various export formats

#### Performance Requirements

- **Live Preview**: < 500ms refresh time for typical sketches
- **Export Speed**: Efficient batch processing for animations and variations
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized for handling large canvas sizes and complex graphics

#### Compatibility

- **Platform**: Primary support for macOS (DrawBot requirement), with potential cross-platform alternatives
- **VSCode**: Compatible with latest VSCode versions
- **Python**: Support for virtual environments and package management

### User Stories

#### As a Creative Coder

- I want to quickly create new sketches so I can rapidly iterate on ideas
- I want to see live previews of my work so I can get immediate feedback
- I want to organize my sketches logically so I can find and reference past work
- I want reliable export tools so I can share my finished work

#### As an Educator

- I want example sketches and tutorials so I can teach programming concepts visually
- I want to customize templates so students can focus on core concepts
- I want easy export tools so students can share their work
- I want a stable, well-documented system that doesn't break during class

#### As a Student

- I want clear examples and documentation so I can learn creative coding techniques
- I want to see my code changes immediately so I can understand cause and effect
- I want helpful error messages when things go wrong

### Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Number of active sketches created per week
- **Engagement**: Average time spent in live preview mode
- **Learning**: Completion rate of tutorial content
- **Output**: Number of sketches exported/shared
- **Retention**: Weekly active users over time

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP) ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Basic sketch file structure and organization (folder-based structure)
- ✅ Core DrawBot API integration with safety features
- ✅ Professional CLI with comprehensive commands
- ✅ Template system with 5 production-ready templates
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (35+ tests)

#### Phase 2: Core Enhancement (CURRENT FOCUS)

- **Live Preview**: Real-time preview of sketch output as code changes
- **VSCode Extension**: Dedicated IDE integration and commands
- **Enhanced Export**: Improved export capabilities and formats
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive tutorials and example gallery

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (See: prd_advanced_features.md)

- Animation framework and timeline tools
- Parameter control system
- Advanced creative tools and utilities

#### Phase 4: Community & Ecosystem

- Sharing and collaboration features
- Plugin system for extensions
- Advanced batch processing and workflow tools

### Technical Architecture

#### Project Structure

```bash
drawbot-vscode-sketchbook/
├── sketches/           # User sketch files
├── templates/          # Sketch templates
├── examples/          # Example sketches

├── docs/              # Documentation and tutorials
└── extensions/        # VSCode extension files
```

#### Core Components

- ✅ **Sketch Runner**: Executes and monitors sketch files with safety features
- **Preview Engine**: Renders live preview of sketch output (Phase 2)
- ✅ **Export Manager**: Handles export formats (basic implementation complete)
- ✅ **Template Engine**: Manages and instantiates sketch templates
- **VSCode Extension**: Provides IDE integration and commands (Phase 2)

### Risks & Mitigations

- **DrawBot Dependency**: Limited to macOS - explore cross-platform alternatives like Cairo or Skia
- **Performance**: Large sketches may slow live preview - implement intelligent caching and optimization
- **Learning Curve**: Complex API - provide comprehensive documentation and examples
- **Maintenance**: Keep up with DrawBot updates - establish testing and compatibility processes

### Future Considerations

- **Web Version**: Browser-based version using p5.js or similar
- **Cross-Platform**: Cairo/Skia-based implementation for Windows/Linux
- **AI Integration**: AI-assisted sketch generation and optimization
- **Mobile**: Companion mobile app for viewing and sharing sketches
